Simple bash script to help webdevelopers that use git.

It will create folder with files from last commit, or any commit that we choose with the same folder structure as in our project. After that to update live server or maybe dev server just need to copy content of this folder to our server.

You can choose from what commit script will start looking for changed files and on what commit it should stop.

Usage:

usage: webdev-scripts-git [--version] [--start <commit>] [--finish <commit>] [-o <outputPath>]

default start commit is Head^

default finish commit is HEAD

default output path is PrepareUpload.
